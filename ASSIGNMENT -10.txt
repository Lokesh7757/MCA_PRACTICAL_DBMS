ASSIGNMENT-10

Write a Pl/SQL block to calculate gross salary on basis of basic salary. If 
DA is 40% of basic ,HRA is 20% of basic and PF deduction is 12% of 
basic salary.
Gross salary=Basic Salary+DA+HRA-PF
Accept basic salary from user and pass it to function, function will return 
gross salary
