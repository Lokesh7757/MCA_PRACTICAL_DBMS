);

INSERT INTO Employee10 (ID, Name, Age, Address, Salary)

INSERT INTO Employee10 (ID, Name, Age, Address, Salary)

    v_employee_count NUMBER := 0;
BEGIN

    SELECT MIN(Salary) INTO v_min_salary FROM Employee10;
    
    FOR emp IN (SELECT * FROM Employee10 WHERE Salary = v_min_salary) LOOP
